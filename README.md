# Multiplayer Particle Simulator
This project seeks to expand upon my previous work on recreating the classic falling sand particle sim genre for the modern web by adding multi-player support.
This branch is testing a new action management system that is slower over all, but paves the way for parallel chunk processing, equally prioritizes all actions, and is compatible with any future sand behaviors of arbitrary complexity.
